# QAOA-MaxCut

A short notebook that shows how one can solve the MaxCut problem on small graphs using QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm) with Qiskit. Includes a brute-force solution for comparison.

Files:

- `Using_QAOA_to_Solve_the_MaxCut_Problem.ipynb`: Runs MaxCut with brute-force and QAOA, compares results.
- requirements.txt: Package dependencies.

How to use:
1. Install packages:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the notebook.
Works best for small graphs and low QAOA reps!
